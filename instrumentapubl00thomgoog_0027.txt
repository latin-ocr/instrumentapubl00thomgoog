In his account of the conferenee and compaot between Bruce and
the Red Comyn at Perth, in the year 1304, Henry the Minstrel
repeatedly applies the term augment to what Fordun describes as

“ conventio hincinde facta ao fide media, interpositis juramentis, per

“ suas indenturas, cum appositione sigillorum eorundem roborata.’'

The Bruoe and he completyt furth thar bandia3
Syn that samyn nycht thai sellyt with thar hamdis.
This ragmant left the Bruce with Cumyn thar,
With king Edward haym in England can far:
And thar remaynyt quhill this augment war knnwin,
Thre yer and mar or Bruce persewyt hia auin.
¹ Sum men demys that Cumyn that ragntent send;
Sum men tharfor agaynys makia defend.
nallatenus v. 1147.

In these instanoes‚ the import of the term is obviously the same as

in the passages previously quoted from History and Record3 but in

other authors, of a somewhat later date, the word occurs in a much

more vague and general sense. Thus in various passages of the

prologues to the translation of Virgil's AEneid by Gavin Douglas:

Gis I had not bene to ana boundis consueuit,
Of my bad wit perchanoe I thocht have fenit
In ryme an rogmen twiae als curiouse,

Bot not be twenty part aa sentencias-Prfface, p. 8, 24.

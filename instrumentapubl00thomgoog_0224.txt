till he reached the district of the Enyie, on the eastern bruk of the Spey, (leuony
sur la rios'ere de ἃμ) does not seem to require any illustratiod. Having crossed
thet river into the country of Moroy, on Wednesduy the 25th of July, he is stated to
have tested et the manour of llepeneche, (Ropenacke mnoir eu Ie pays de Menoe)
a neme of which no trece hss been found.

On the following day, Edwerd reached the exone point of his northern expedition,
ot Elgin, (lo cite deigin,) where he retained till Sundsy the soth, when on his
return, he stopped at Rothes on the western bank of the Spey, (Roreise moscin) ond
on Mondey at Inverchnrrsch‚ (Ysterkeroche,) o small hemlet in the mouutsins be·
tween Stroth-Fiddich ond Stroth-Doversn, situntcd on o streamlet of the seme neme
which fulls into the river Doveran, three miles to the north of the porish kirk of
Cebrach. On the following day he reached the cestle os Kildrummy, (Kyndrolyn
chostel) where he'rested on Wednesdey, the lst of August3 end on Thursdey, is
stated in the Itinerery to heve arrived et the Hospitsl of Kinoordine in the Meerns,
(lorpitol de Kynoordyn en Meroen) apnlpahle mistuke sor Kinourdine O'Neil in
Aberdeenshire, about eighteen miles from Kildrummy, end where alone there existed sn
Hospitsl. On the next day, Fridoy the sd, it seems probable that he reached the other
Kincsrdine in the Mesrns, and proceeded, on Seturday the 4th, to Brechin, (Ia cite
de Breghyn) thence to Aberbrothoclr, (tabaye de Berhrodoct) to Dundee, to Boligerny,
the cestle of Sir Robert Cambron, situeted in the Curse os Gowry, (Boligornoch le
roge Cleo-rtet) and to Perth. His subsequent course through the county of rire,
along the northern benks of the Forth, end hom Stirling onwerds to Berwick, requires

no illustration.

As the purpose of these desultory remarks hos not been to discnss any of the contro-
verted or doubtful points of history connected with this eventful expedition, but
merely to ascertain the successive stages of the route detniled in this ancient ldnernry,

it is hoped thst their minuteness will be perdoned et leest hythe few who tcke an in·
terest in such inquiries.

Lonnorr, January ³1, laet.

Daan Srn,

Wa are highly gratified to find that the Breuni Rotas, which wa
have presented to the Bawnnrvwn Caua, has given general satisfaction.

The choice of the subject, and its preparation for the press, we owe to
our Pcasrnnnr, Mr Triones Tnorusorr3 and it is only such distinguished
antiquarian learning as he possessos, that could have produced the Profaca
which throws so much light upon a subject surrounded with obscurity,
and in which purity and perspicuity of style and illustration are so well}
combined.

We are particularly desirous to malre our acknowledgments to Mr
Tnorrsorv for the obligation he has conferred upon us, by which we have
been enabled to present a work to the annnrvrva Caun worthy of accept·
ance. We, therefore, have to request of you to read this letter at the
first Meeting of the Club,—to have it entered in the Minutes, and to have
it printed and sentin circulation to all who have received the work.

We remain,
Dran Sne,

Your faithful humble servants,

WILLIAM ADAM.
SAML SHEPHERD.

To Drvrn Lumo, Ero.

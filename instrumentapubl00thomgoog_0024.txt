genuine atatimical notioes of the kingdom towards the close of the
thirteenth century.

It may be proper to mention thet the records which have been em·
ployed in this compilation have no particular titles inscribed on them,
and that those here prefixed have been adopted from the lungutge of ’
the instrumente themselves, as sufficiently descriptive of'their nature ·
and contento. They are the same instrumente thet have been usually
known under the uncouth appellation of the Ragman Rolls3 a word, ’
’ the original and proper meaning of which has not been very clearly
ascertained, and as to which it is not here intended to offer any con-
fident opinion. Ita occurrence iu English history and in legal records,

aa well ee in other compositione, although not very frequent, is by'

no means singular, and imm these its usual and more exact import

may be conjectured.

In the English statute Book, anAet of the fourth year oi Edward 1.
is entitled, in the only copy of it now extant, ‘⁴ statutum de J usti-
“ ciariis assignandis, quod vocatur Rogcmon ;” (Μαικία oftde Roaiam
Vol. i. p. 44.) but neither in the form nor tenour of the aet is there
any obvious reason for that very peculias appellation3 and Spelmen,
who quotes no other exemplification of the word, is contented with
aemang rt 'aa tae uae ora particular salute.

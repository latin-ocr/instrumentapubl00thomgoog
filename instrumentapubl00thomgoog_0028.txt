Wold thou this buke Ι sold to the dedere,

Quhilk war impossibill til expreme at eohorte3
Virgill it fullos sentence over all qnhare‚

Bqt here intill, es Servius oen propone,

His hie knawlege he shawis, that every sorte

Oi his clausis eomprehend sic sentenne,
There bene thereos, set thou think this bot oporte,

Mede grete rogmmtis of hie intelligence.

Thy buke is bot bribry, said the berne than,
Βοι Ι sal lere the ane lessoun ιο leis el thy pene:
With that he raucht me ane roll: to rede 1 begane,
The royetest ane regeneret with mony ratt rime,
Of all the mowis in this mold, sen God merkit men,
The moving of the mepemound, e how the mone echone,
The pleuch‚ and the poles, the planettis began,
The son, the sevin sternis, and the Chnrle wane,
The elwand, the elementis, end Arthnris huffe,

The horne and the hand staffe,

Preter Jhone end port Me,

Quhy the oorne has the cehe,
And kow weris elufe.

These instenoes seem ιο prove that et the beginning of the six-

teenth century the word was applied to oompositions of every mis-
oellnneous sort, end far different from those solemn and technioal

deeds to which it was appropriated at an earlier period. This may
be further illustrated hy its use in the first stonza of Sir David
Lindsry’s “ Answer to the Kingis Flyting.’'

a Roman road, called the Wheel-causeway, or the Wheel-rig, and near to which are the
remains of a Peel or small castellated house of the saure name; and that this was the
Wyel of the ltinerary, and the resting place os Edward, there cau he no doubt lt
must have been nearly in the same line that another celebrated journey was accom-
plished in much less time; that of Quecn Mary, from Jedhurgh to Hermitege Castle,
and back again, on the l6th of October 1⁵66.

ln Edward's subsequent progress from the horden to Edinburgh, Linlithgow, and
Stirling, as detailed iu the Itinerary, there occur no topographioal obscurities. On

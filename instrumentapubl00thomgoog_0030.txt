illustrations of the meaning of this word ought perhaps to have

entirely superseded the preceding details, is inclined to prefer a

infrequent use of it, implying accusation or crimination. It must

to be completely traoed in the acts of homage there reoorded; but
a more minute detail is to be found in a contemporary document,
which has already been printed in the hliscellany of the Bannatyne

Club, and in the Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of
